# crow-nest engine spec

**Status: fully approved by robin on 2026-09-02 (all six sections, issue crow-nest #4).**

Approved section by section (issue crow-nest #4; a section is truth only after robin's
approval is recorded there). Environment for every number: `docs/system-landscape.md`.
Methodology: Crow #159. No north star in the record's sense — misses are measured
results that re-cut stages.

---

## Section 0 — goals and operating points (APPROVED by robin 2026-09-02, with the prefill provenance integrated)

### 0.1 Status of the goals

Product requirements from robin (2026-09-01/02, epic #1). They are targets the engine
aims at and the harness reports against — the record's discipline stands: a miss is a
measured result that re-cuts a stage (timebox guard), never a project failure. No goal
is a pass/fail gate.

### 0.2 Context

- **Floor 200,000 tokens** — every shipped configuration must hold ≥ 200k; the engine
  refuses a configuration that cannot.
- **Default 262,144** (architecture ceiling) with **FP8-KV**; slider [200k, 262,144].
- The oracle checks FP8-KV against the BF16 reference; if it goes red, the fallback
  operating point is 200k + BF16-KV (~4.6 GiB KV).
- State at default: KV ~3.0 GiB (FP8) / ~6.0 GiB (BF16), GDN ~0.12 GB (f32, fixed),
  QSA per its budget of 2,048 tokens.

### 0.3 Throughput targets, with their measurement points

- **Decode ≥ 42 tok/s** — measured at batch 1 (`-np 1`), session filled to the **200k
  floor** (not the ceiling), after a discarded warm-up request; reported against the
  interleaved llama.cpp baseline on this machine (41 tok/s endstand, same session).
- **Prefill ≥ 972 tok/s**, binding at the **32k operating point**, measured as the
  **completed-prompt average** (prompt tokens ÷ prompt time). Instantaneous rates are
  reported alongside but never substitute for the average.
  - Provenance (grounded 2026-09-02): 972 first appears as the baseline's instantaneous
    rate at 26 % of a ~31.7k-token prefill (`crow-lab/runs/2026-08-30-levers-159/
    control-03`: n_tokens 8,245, 972.24 tok/s). The completed-32k baseline average is
    ~750 tok/s (ladder: 750.75 at 30,777 tokens). The target is therefore honestly a
    ~+29 % stretch over baseline at 32k — a goal, not a gate.
- Every throughput number names: context fill, prompt length, chunk size, quant of both
  engines under test.

### 0.4 Latency metrics

- **TTFT** (time to first token) at the 200k floor with a named prompt length; target
  set by robin against crow-nest's first measured prefill (no invented number now).
- **Mean inter-token latency** is implied by the decode goal: 42 tok/s ⇔ ~23.8 ms.
- "Minimal latency" as a design constraint is already decided and needs no number: no
  host in the hot loop, no kernel launch for synchronization (job ring, stream memops).

### 0.5 Measurement discipline (binding)

Interleaved A/B in the same session, one variable at a time, resolution stated,
environment per `docs/system-landscape.md`. Performance is a measurement, not a
condition.

---

## Section 1 — model format and streaming converter (APPROVED by robin 2026-09-02: BF16 keep-set as proposed; 551 GB free NVMe confirmed)

> **Official name (robin, 2026-09-02): the format and quant family is CNQ; the base
> variant is CNQ4.5** (container magic `CNQ1`, 4.5 bpw NVFP4). Planned follow-ups inherit
> the scheme: CNQ4.5-C (per-expert calibrated scales, stage 2), CNQ4.5-P8 (PLE block
> exchanged to FP8 if the oracle goes red). KV dtype stays runtime config, not part of
> the name. First artifact: `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-CNQ4.5.cnq`.

### 1.1 Input

The original safetensors: 131 shards, 359,999,963,128 B, revision
`de4b8e4d43b917e7706784d8bb445c9af86a3540`, read with mmap streaming — the model is
never held in RAM. Disk requirement for a conversion: input 360 GB + output ~101 GB
(plus a verification sidecar) — **~470 GB free NVMe**.

### 1.2 Output format (own container, no GGUF)

- **Container**: own binary, shard-aligned, JSON header with the tensor index
  (name, logical dtype, shape, block format, file offset) — conceptually safetensors'
  header, not its code; the container is ours.
- **Quantized weights**: NVFP4 blocks per ggml geometry — 64 values per block, 32 B
  packed E2M1 + 4 ue4m3 scales (one per 16-wide sub-block) = 36 B / 64 values = 4.5 bpw,
  **plus one global f32 scale per tensor** (two-level scaling; probe-pinned hardware
  facts apply, the global scale is a converter convention to be validated numerically in
  the first oracle run).
- **Kept in BF16** (proposal): embeddings and `lm_head` (untied, 2 × 1.27 GB BF16 —
  2.5 GB of 360, no reason to risk them), **router GEMM** (2560 × 512 per layer) and
  `shared_expert_gate`, all norms (`hc_norm` et al.). Routing stability and norm
  precision are cheap to keep.
- **Everything else** (GDN, attention, hyper-connection low-rank, experts, shared
  expert): NVFP4.
- **PLE block**: NVFP4, **exchangeable** — the header tags it as a self-contained
  section so an FP8 swap (oracle fallback) needs no format change.
- **ViT + MTP**: carried in the format, tagged optional-to-load (decision 2026-09-02).
- **KV dtype is runtime config** (FP8 E4M3 default), not file content.

### 1.3 Stage 1 — calibration-free RTN

Shard-streaming on read AND write; each tensor quantized on the fly, per-tensor global
scale computed before emitting its blocks; output written incrementally so at most one
working copy exists beyond input and output.

### 1.4 Stage 2 — per-expert calibration (separate ticket, later)

Re-emission of scales only (format unchanged) from Crow's routing statistics —
ModelOpt's `--calib_all_experts` idea with real traffic instead of synthetic samples.

### 1.5 Acceptance

- Round-trip decode of sample tensors matches BF16 reference within documented error;
  per-tensor max/mean deltas recorded in a verification sidecar next to the output.
- The oracle (#6) consumes the **unquantized originals** — this stage's output is never
  the quality reference.

### 1.6 Resolved (robin, 2026-09-02)

- BF16 keep-set approved as proposed (embeddings, lm_head, router GEMM, gates, norms).
- Disk: 551 GB free NVMe — conversion runs fit comfortably (~470 GB needed).
- Budget consequence carried into section 2: the BF16 keep-set adds ~1.8 GB dense
  VRAM; the hard hot-set ceiling drops from ~177 to ~169 experts/layer (default 160
  unchanged, loader auto-clamps).

---

## Section 2 — memory layout: residency, PLE window, three-state manager (APPROVED by robin 2026-09-02)

### 2.1 VRAM budget at the default operating point (262k context, FP8-KV)

| item | GB | note |
|---|---|---|
| dense resident | ~6.0 | 12.5 GB BF16 → NVFP4 (~3.5) + BF16 keep-set 2.5 (embeddings, lm_head, router, gates, norms); ViT/MTP carried in file, NOT loaded at this stage |
| hot experts | N × 0.132 | 2.76 MB per expert per layer × 48 layers; default N=160 → 21.2 GB |
| KV cache | ~3.2 | FP8 E4M3, 12 KiB/token × 262,144; BF16 would be 6.4 |
| GDN state + QSA | ~0.3 | GDN f32 36 × ~3.1 MB ≈ 0.11; QSA per budget 2048 |
| PLE hot-row cache | 1.0–2.0 | window cache, sized by telemetry (2.2) |
| activations + graph pools | 1.5–2.0 | decode graphs are small; measured at first integration |
| **total non-expert** | **~13.0–13.5** | of 34.4 (32 GiB) |
| **expert budget** | **~20.9–21.4** | → hard ceiling **~158–162** experts/layer with honest pool sizing |

Loader rule (binding): N=160 is the **target**; the loader verifies the full budget with
measured overheads at load time and auto-clamps N if the sum exceeds VRAM — it refuses
configurations that fall below the 200k context floor, never silently degrades context.

### 2.2 Expert residency (per layer, data-driven)

- Residency sets are **per-layer top-N by selection frequency** — per-layer ranking, not
  the global curve (#3; per-layer selection achieves ≥ the global coverage).
- Warm-up: first runs accumulate per-layer selection counts (every routed choice counts,
  hit or miss — the print_locality discipline), promote the top-N per layer, and persist
  the sets in a sidecar next to the model file; refreshable by config or command.
- Routing-gated skip: a layer whose 10 routed experts are all resident has **no cold
  job at all** — the handoff count responds to this, measured per token (#7 acceptance).

### 2.3 Cold path (variant A; stager built for C from day 1)

- GPU publishes cold jobs (expert IDs per layer) into the pinned job ring via
  `cuStreamWriteValue32`; the stager gathers weights (RAM tier) into pinned staging
  blocks and streams H2D; the GPU waits on per-job flags via `cuStreamWaitValue32`.
- No host in the hot loop, no kernel launch for synchronization, no full-device barrier.
- The stager's source is an interface from day 1: RAM tier now, NVMe tier (variant C) is
  a second backend of the same interface (decision 2026-09-02). "Compute on CPU"
  (variant B) stays a policy option behind the same interface, unbuilt.
- Per-layer policy field chooses the cold path by bandwidth, not hardcoded.

### 2.4 PLE (one layer, 128 tables of [2,500,012, 160])

- On disk NVFP4 (~28.8 GB), accessed as an **NVMe-mmap window** with a VRAM hot-row
  cache (default 1.0–2.0 GB, sized by hit-rate telemetry).
- Row indices computed **host-side per token** first (llama.cpp's proven
  `set_input` pattern — small H2D of indices); GPU-side indexing is a later refinement,
  not a stage gate.
- Row format NVFP4, block-exchangeable to FP8 (section 1); `ple_layer_ids: [2]` vs
  tensors on `layers.1` — the converter resolves the index once and records the
  resolution in the header.
- Row granularity on NVMe: a row is ~108 B NVFP4; reads happen at page granularity, so
  the cache design assumes read amplification (~37 rows per 4 KB page) and lets the
  hot-row cache absorb it — hit rate is measured, never assumed.

### 2.5 Three-state manager

- **KV**: 12 full-attention layers, 2 KV heads × head_dim 256, FP8 E4M3 default, BF16
  fallback via config; allocation at load for the configured context; resize only
  across full reloads (no mid-session shrink in stage 1).
- **GDN recurrent state**: 36 layers, f32 (16 K / 48 V heads at 128, conv kernel 4) —
  fixed size, context-independent.
- **QSA indexer cache**: budget 2,048 tokens, compress ratio 4 — third state kind,
  allocated alongside KV (`llama-memory-hybrid-idx` as the shape reference).
- Hyper-connections: `hc_norm` state is part of the weights, the 10240-wide residual
  stream is activation, not state.
- The manager owns all three kinds; stages never allocate around it (no leaks across
  stages, one accounting).

### 2.6 Acceptance

- Budget table verified by the loader on this machine (measured, not estimated, pool
  sizes); auto-clamp demonstrated by forcing N=192.
- Warm-up promotion demonstrated: coverage of the persisted sets vs the #3 curve.
- Cold-job path end to end on synthetic traffic before the first real decode.

## Section 3 — scheduler: job ring, routing-gated skip, cold-path policy (APPROVED by robin 2026-09-02)

### 3.1 The constraint the scheduler exists for

The borrowed engine's fixed term is 67.1 % synchronization at 62 CPU↔GPU handoffs per
token; a swapped barrier costs 4–6 ms (Crow #186). Binding design constraints: **no host
in the hot loop, no kernel launch for synchronization, no full-device barrier between
layers.** The decode loop per token: embeddings + PLE gather → 48 layers (36 GDN, 12
full attention, interleaved per `layer_types`) under hyper-connections → per MoE layer:
router on GPU → top-10 + shared expert → resident experts computed immediately → cold
experts via the job ring → `shared_expert_gate` combine.

### 3.2 Job ring (the handoff)

- Pinned host-memory ring, job descriptors 64-byte aligned (exl3 `moe_handoff.h`
  pattern): layer id, job kind, cold expert ids (≤ 10), sequence number, flag slots.
- The **descriptor is written by device-side mapped writes** from a small GPU kernel
  (the router result never leaves the GPU to produce it); publication of the flag goes
  through `cuStreamWriteValue32`. The stager thread busy-polls the pinned ring (no sync
  primitives), gathers cold expert weights from the RAM tier into pinned staging blocks,
  copies H2D on a dedicated copy stream, and raises the completion flag; the GPU's cold
  expert compute is enqueued behind `cuStreamWaitValue32` on that flag.
- **Overlap is the design goal, not alternation**: resident-expert compute and
  subsequent dense work proceed while the stager services cold jobs.
- Ring sizing: ≥ 256 slots (≤ 48 jobs/token worst case), sequence numbers against
  wraparound; a dead stager fails the engine loudly — no silent stall, ever.

### 3.3 Routing-gated skip

- Residency bitmaps (one per layer, from section 2.2's sets) live on the GPU; the skip
  decision is derived on-GPU from routing vs bitmap. A layer whose 10 routed experts are
  all resident publishes **no job**; a layer with k cold experts publishes exactly one
  job carrying those k ids.

### 3.4 Cold-path policy (AMENDED 2026-09-02, robin approved: zero-copy replaces stream-weights as primary)

Measurement history that drove the amendment: per-layer ring round trips measured
~3.1–3.4 ms on WDDM (28 cold layers/token → dead); speculative cross-token prefetch
measured 0.2–0.7 % prefetch gain (dead — the hot set already IS the temporal
structure); zero-copy direct read measured 21.6–25.1 GB/s (probe 3). HGS probed: no
benefit for driver-API handoffs (4.7 vs 3.1 ms).

- **Cold path A′ "zero-copy direct read" (primary)**: expert GEMM kernels take VRAM
  pointers for resident experts and PINNED HOST pointers for cold ones — the GPU pulls
  weights over PCIe inside the GEMM. No copy, no submission, no stall, no speculation.
  Cost: ~111 MB/token at ~23 GB/s ≈ 4.8 ms (N=160) / ~3.3 ms (N=176), spread across
  layers inside the GEMMs. Pinned cold tier ≈ 43–47 GB of 64 GB host RAM.
- **The job ring + stager remain for the control plane**: residency-set swaps,
  NVMe-tier staging (variant C), refresh, telemetry — off the decode critical path.
  Variant B (CPU compute) stays reserved; variant A (stream-weights) is retired from
  the primary path (kept behind the ring interface for tier transitions).
- Policy is still per layer, chosen at load, fixed per session.

### 3.5 PLE in the loop

- PLE row indices are computed host-side per token (section 2.4) — the one host touch
  per token outside the ring: pure index math, a few KB H2D, off the critical ring.

### 3.6 Acceptance

- Ring round-trip microbenchmark on Windows (resolution stated) against the 4–6 ms
  barrier cost from #186 — Windows FIRST (strand 2: exl3 memops unexercised on Windows).
- Synthetic 48-layer MoE pass: measured skips, cold jobs, bytes per token.
- A timestamped trace of a decode step shows **zero host wakes per layer** — the 62
  handoffs must collapse to ring jobs only.

## Section 4 — kernel path: sm_120a FP4 (APPROVED by robin 2026-09-02)

### 4.1 Target and probe-pinned facts

- Compile target **`compute_120a`** — plain `sm_120` is rejected by ptxas (probe 2);
  llama.cpp builds `120a-real` for the same reason. NVRTC at load time (probe 1/2
  chain), no nvcc dependency at runtime.
- Instruction:
  `mma.sync.aligned…kind::mxf4nvf4.block_scale.scale_vec::4X.m16n8k64.row.col.f32.e2m1.e2m1.f32.ue4m3`.
- Fragment layouts as pinned by probe 2 (LSB-first nibbles at bit 4j in both operands;
  scale operand = one u32 per matrix, byte i = ue4m3 scale of the 16-wide k-sub-block;
  a/b/D geometry per RESULTS.md) — the engine's kernels reuse these layouts verbatim,
  and the probe's CPU reference (delta exactly 0 on dyadic inputs) is the numerics test.

### 4.2 Kernel families the model needs

1. **Expert GEMMs, fused**: `gate_up [512,1280,2560]`, `down [512,2560,640]`, batched
   over the ≤ 10 routed (+ 1 shared) per token. Our format keeps per-expert blocks
   contiguous, so the active set is directly addressable — no used-expert copy stage in
   the graph.
2. **Dense paths**: hidden 2560 ↔ residual stream 10240 (hyper-connections), attention
   QKVO, GDN projections (`in_proj_qkvz`, `out_proj`), `conv1d`, PLE gather + conv.
3. **Router**: BF16 GEMM 2560 × 512 (kept BF16 per section 1).
4. **Attention** (12 layers): 24 heads × head_dim 256, GQA 2 KV heads, partial rotary
   0.25, mrope interleaved [11,11,10] — compute stays BF16/FP8 (flash-attention style);
   FP4 is a weight format, not an attention math format. QSA indexer (budget 2048) as
   its own small kernel family.
5. **GDN** (36 layers): gated delta-net with sigmoid output gate — recurrent/chunked
   custom kernel family; reading templates: mistral.rs `qwen3_next.rs`, the transformers
   reference (oracle-side). SSM state f32.

### 4.3 Kernel hygiene

- Thin kernels (constant 4): one module per family, NVRTC-compiled at load, shared
  block-scaled-MMA core.
- Numerics gate in this order: kernel vs probe CPU reference → layer vs oracle (#6).
- No tok/s anywhere in kernel code or comments — measurement goes through the harness.

### 4.4 Ampere/Ada fallback

Own stage after this path works (decision 2026-09-02, amended): separate INT4/Q4 kernel
family without block-scale MMA, dispatch per architecture at load, own ticket and
timebox (created with spec section 6). Until then the engine runs Blackwell-only.

### 4.5 Acceptance

- All families pass numerics (probe reference, then oracle per layer) on this machine.
- `compute_120a` load verified on Windows (probe chain); Linux verification is part of
  the fallback stage's environment work, before any Linux number is quoted.

---

## Section 5 — correctness: oracle, parity gates, ten-task gate (APPROVED by robin 2026-09-02)

### 5.1 Oracles

- **Layer-wise oracle from the unquantized originals**: the transformers 5.8.x
  `qwen4_exp` reference, one layer at a time from the safetensors (one layer fits
  64 GB RAM; the model does not), no `trust_remote_code` needed (reference lives
  upstream). Early acceptance item: verify the reference's kernel imports
  (`fla`, `causal_conv1d`, triton) have CPU fallbacks so a layer runs oracle-side
  without a GPU path — strand 1 flagged this as unverified; it gates the oracle.
- **QSA-under-budget density oracle**: below `indexer_top_k + compress_ratio − 1`
  cached tokens, QSA is dense by construction — bit-identical on BF16/F32 (PR #27742:
  max logit delta 0.0 over 2,051 rows). A free correctness gate for the whole attention
  path.
- **`test-llama-archs` is not the oracle** (no PLE tensors, insensitive to the GDN QKV
  segmentation — plumbing only).
- **Quantization quality**: converter emits a per-tensor delta sidecar (section 1.5);
  FP8-KV vs BF16 and PLE-NVFP4 vs BF16 are oracle comparisons with pre-agreed fallbacks
  (sections 0.2, 1.2) — the converter never judges its own output.

### 5.2 Gates per stage

- **Parity gate**: every stage is measured against llama.cpp on this machine (#159:
  interleaved, same session, one variable, resolution stated) **and** against its own
  previous stage. Every number carries its operating point (section 0).
- **Ten-task gate**: before anything ships into Crow, the fixed ten-task series runs
  identically on both engines and the answers are compared for correctness (not speed).
  The concrete ten tasks are fixed from Crow's real workload before stage #11 starts;
  crow-lab's 2026-09-01-tasks series (t1–t6) is the seed set.

### 5.3 Honesty rules (binding)

Numbers only through the harness; no foreign tok/s transferred onto this machine; every
claim has an object (a file, a run, a commit); provenance is recorded like the 972 note
in section 0.3.

---

## Section 6 — stages and timeboxes (APPROVED by robin 2026-09-02 — boxes are guards, not deadlines)

### 6.1 Sequencing

Three parallel tracks at the start, then the long pole:

| track | stage (ticket) | proposed box | parallel with |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | #5 streaming converter (format, RTN stage 1) | 2 weeks | B, C |
| B | #6 oracle + parity harness | 2 weeks | A, C |
| C | #7 job ring + stream memops, Windows first | 1 week | A, B |
| D | #10 FP4 kernels (five families) | **5 weeks** | runs after C, alongside E, F |
| E | #8 residency scheduler + cold path | 3 weeks | after C, alongside D |
| F | #9 three-state memory manager | 2 weeks | after B, alongside D |
| G | #11 first end-to-end decode + standing parity series | 2 weeks | after D, E, F |

Critical path ≈ **12–14 weeks** to the first measured decode. The Ampere/Ada fallback
stage gets its ticket with this section's approval (section 4.4) and runs after #10.

### 6.2 The cut rule (constant 5)

A stage that misses its box is **re-cut** — split into smaller stages with a new box —
never terminated, and the project carries no end date. A box is a guard that forces the
re-cut conversation, nothing else.

### 6.3 Definition of done

Per stage: the acceptance section of its ticket, plus the parity gate (5.2) with the
operating points of section 0. "Done" is recorded on the ticket, board follows.
